# Cantina Security Review Report

This repository is a template for the basic elements of a Cantina security review report, which are written semi-automatically by the Cantina team, and manually curated before generating the PDF file.

DO NOT USE THIS REPOSITORY ON ITS OWN, IT IS INTENDED TO BE USED BY THE REPORT-GENERATING LOGIC.
